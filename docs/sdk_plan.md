# QF Workflow SDK Plan

## Vision

The QF Workflow SDK is a practical agentic workflow kit for quants, researchers, data scientists, and portfolio teams. Its job is to turn repeated research and model-development work into reliable, inspectable workflows made from agents, hooks, instructions, prompts, templates, and validation gates.

The SDK should help a team move from idea to documented, reviewed, reproducible quant artifact with less manual coordination and fewer hidden assumptions.

## Current State

The repository already contains a useful skeleton:

- `.agents/` contains role-specific assistant files for general, Git, and design workflows.
- `.githooks/` contains commit, pre-commit, and pre-push hooks.
- `.github/` contains CI, PR, issue, Dependabot, and Git workflow templates.
- `agents/`, `instructions/`, `prompts/`, `templates/`, and `examples/` contain the initial public SDK slice.
- `hooks/` exists as the future public hook surface, while active local Git hooks live in `.githooks/`.
- `setup-hooks.sh` wires local Git hooks into a checkout.

The working tree has been reshaped away from the older app layout and toward the SDK structure described here.

## Target Users

- Quant researchers building alpha signals, backtests, risk models, optimizers, and execution logic.
- Data scientists developing features, forecasts, experiments, and model documentation.
- Research leads who need reviewable assumptions, experiment traceability, and handoff quality.
- Platform engineers who want agentic workflow conventions without forcing every team into one monolithic tool.

## Core SDK Surfaces

### Agents

Agents should be focused role definitions that can be used by humans or automation systems. Recommended initial agents:

- Research Analyst Agent: turns a hypothesis into a research plan, assumptions, data needs, and acceptance criteria.
- Data Quality Agent: checks data contracts, missingness, survivorship risk, leakage risk, joins, and timestamp alignment.
- Feature Engineering Agent: proposes, documents, and reviews feature transformations.
- Modeling Agent: assists with model selection, validation plans, experiment tracking, and error analysis.
- Backtest Review Agent: reviews simulation assumptions, transaction costs, lookahead bias, benchmark choice, and fragility.
- Risk Agent: reviews factor exposure, concentration, drawdown, stress, and scenario behavior.
- Documentation Agent: creates model cards, research memos, dataset cards, runbooks, and decision logs.
- Git and Release Agent: keeps commits, branches, PRs, changelogs, and validation gates clean.

### Hooks

Hooks should enforce lightweight quality gates before work leaves a machine or branch:

- Commit message validation using Conventional Commits.
- Notebook output and large artifact checks.
- Python formatting and lint checks when Python code is present.
- Unit, smoke, or regression test selection based on changed files.
- Documentation freshness checks for changed models, datasets, and experiments.
- Secrets, credentials, and private data path checks.

### Instructions

Instructions should define stable behavior that agents reuse:

- Quant research review protocol.
- Backtest integrity checklist.
- Dataset and feature documentation standards.
- Model validation and monitoring standards.
- Reproducibility expectations for notebooks, scripts, configs, and outputs.
- Git, PR, and release expectations.

### Prompts

Prompts should be task-ready, composable starting points:

- Draft a research plan from a hypothesis.
- Convert notebook exploration into a reproducible script plan.
- Review a backtest for lookahead bias and overfitting risk.
- Generate a model card.
- Generate a dataset card.
- Write an experiment summary.
- Create a PR review checklist for a quant change.
- Produce a handoff memo for a model or signal.

### Templates

The SDK should include document and code templates:

- Research memo.
- Model card.
- Dataset card.
- Experiment report.
- Backtest report.
- Risk review.
- Production readiness checklist.
- Incident/postmortem template for data or model issues.

The hidden `.agents/` folder can remain as adapter-specific or internal agent metadata, while the public `agents/` folder becomes the SDK-facing catalog.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Documentation and Taxonomy

- Add a top-level README that explains the SDK purpose and current state.
- Add an agentic dictionary that defines the vocabulary used across the SDK.
- Add this plan and a handoff document under `docs/`.
- Identify and document any remaining seed content that must be promoted into public SDK surfaces.

### Phase 2: Public Agent Catalog

- Create public agent folders under `agents/`.
- Give each agent a `README.md`, `prompt.md`, `instructions.md`, and `tasks.md`.
- Keep agent responsibilities narrow enough that they can be selected automatically.
- Add examples of when to invoke each agent.

### Phase 3: Quant Workflow Instructions and Prompts

- Add reusable instructions for research, data quality, modeling, backtesting, documentation, and Git workflow.
- Add prompt templates for high-frequency quant tasks.
- Add model and dataset documentation templates.
- Make every prompt specify inputs, outputs, assumptions, and validation checks.

### Phase 4: Hooks and Quality Gates

- Keep hook language aligned with quant workflow and SDK validation needs.
- Add checks for notebook output, large binary artifacts, secrets, stale docs, and changed model files.
- Make hooks degrade gracefully when optional tools are missing.
- Document local setup and bypass policy.

### Phase 5: Examples and Reference Workflows

- Add example workflows for alpha research, model documentation, backtest review, and production handoff.
- Include sample folder layouts for Python projects, notebook-heavy research, and mixed data/model repositories.
- Add one complete end-to-end example from hypothesis to handoff memo.

### Phase 6: Packaging and Adoption

- Decide whether this remains a copyable repo scaffold, a Python package, a CLI, or a hybrid.
- Add installation and upgrade guidance.
- Add versioning, changelog, and compatibility policy.
- Add contribution guidelines that reflect quant workflow review needs.

## Design Principles

- Make expert review easier, not optional.
- Prefer narrow agents with clear responsibilities over broad assistants.
- Keep every generated artifact auditable and source-linked.
- Treat data lineage, time alignment, and leakage risk as first-class concerns.
- Encourage reproducibility without blocking exploratory research.
- Use hooks as guardrails, not traps.
- Make documentation part of the workflow, not an after-the-fact chore.

## Near-Term Backlog

- Add `agents/feature_engineering/`, `agents/modeling/`, `agents/risk/`, `agents/documentation/`, and `agents/git_release/`.
- Add public hook scripts for notebook output, large artifacts, secrets, and stale docs.
- Add richer examples for risk models, forecast models, and production handoff.
- Add Markdown link checks and public agent contract validation in CI.
- Add an adoption guide for using the SDK in an existing quant repo.

## Open Decisions

- Should the SDK target one primary runtime such as Python, or remain language-agnostic?
- Should notebook handling be advisory only, or enforced through hooks?
- Should agents be optimized for Codex-style local workflows, general LLM systems, or both?
- Should the SDK ship with a CLI for copying agents, prompts, hooks, and templates into downstream repos?
- What minimum documentation should be required before a model or strategy can be considered handoff-ready?

## Success Criteria

- A new quant repo can install or copy the SDK and immediately get useful agents, hooks, prompts, and documentation templates.
- A researcher can start from a hypothesis and produce a reviewed research memo, reproducible experiment summary, and handoff document.
- A reviewer can quickly see assumptions, data lineage, model choices, validation results, and known limitations.
- The SDK reduces repeated setup work without hiding important judgment calls.
