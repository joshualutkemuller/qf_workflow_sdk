# QF Workflow SDK Agents

This folder contains focused agent support files for the QF Workflow SDK repository.

## Structure
- `prompt.md` — global repository assistant prompt
- `instructions.md` — global behavior and constraints
- `tasks.md` — general repo task catalog
- `git/` — Git/GitHub workflow assistant files
- `design/` — workflow and documentation design helper files

## Usage
- Use the Git-focused agent when you need branch status, commit validation, or PR workflow guidance.
- Use the design helper agent when you need workflow polish, documentation structure, or handoff alignment.
- Keep files small and role-specific so future automation can pick the right agent by folder.
